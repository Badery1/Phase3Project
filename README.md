# Phase3Project


Things to impliment!
    
    -MAKE SURE ALL EXCEPTIONS ARE HANDLED TO AVOID CRASHES
    -When player dies, make them no longer selectable to play.
    -Add a narrative to day 0 for immersion.
    -Add delays to the burning of logs and result.
    -Split actions between an inside cabin, and outside cabing (such as burning logs while in cabin, and gathering logs while outside cabin)
        -Above requires a new action such as leave cabin, and return to cabin (as well as a narrative addition (print message) to give more depth to player actions)
    
Features that might be more involved, but cool.
    
    -Add a new option when outside to adventure consuming one of your daily actions to encounter a random event
        -Events such as (losing more temperature, finding an axe upgrade to gather more wood per attempt, an upgrade to have more daily actions, instant exhaustion(no more daily attempts))
            -Basically a risk/reward system
    -Clearing terminal after each action so that only current selection is shown

Super involved but potentially awesome features (might be way beyond scope of this project)

    -Ascii art for each player environment (inside cabin, outside cabin, adventuring, random events)
    -seperate pop out terminal instead of running in VSCode terminal
