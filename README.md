# Phase3Project


Things to implement!
    
    -MAKE SURE ALL EXCEPTIONS ARE HANDLED TO AVOID CRASHES
    
Features that might be more involved, but cool.
    
    -Add a new option when outside to adventure consuming one of your daily actions to encounter a random event
        -Events such as (losing more temperature, finding an axe upgrade to gather more wood per attempt, an upgrade to have more daily actions, instant exhaustion(no more daily attempts))
            -Small percentage chance to find a companion that can take its own wood gathering action per day
            -Basically a risk/reward system
    -Clearing terminal after each action so that only current selection is shown
    -Possible easy/medium/hard difficulty determining starting temperature as well as rate days get colder
    -Random % chance of being invaded at night time and you need to burn logs during the night to scare the creatures off (incentive to not burn all logs during each day)
    -Upper limit to temperature (another incentive to not burn all logs)
    -Gathering materials via random events to upgrade house to reduce amount temperature drops each day
    -Potential win condition

Super involved but potentially awesome features (might be way beyond scope of this project)

    -Ascii art for each player environment (inside cabin, outside cabin, adventuring, random events)
    -seperate pop out terminal instead of running in VSCode terminal
        -maybe light background durning day, dark at night
    -Hunger/finding food by another scavenge for food option
