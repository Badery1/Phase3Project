# Phase3Project

    Our project titled "Freexing Cabin" is a survival game that simulates the struggle of surviving in a post-apocalyptic winter. The task of each player is to survive inside a cabin for as long as possible. Each day the temperature drops as players gather resources in order to stay alive as many days as possible. The game runs in a command-line interface (CLI) and incorporates game mechanics and a database to save player progress.

    To start the game run the game.py script in your CLI.

    On "MAIN MENU":
        Choose "1" to create a player and start a new game or select "6" to select an existing player and resume a previous session.

        Select "2" to delete an existing player from the game. 

        Select "3" to display all existing players 3 and their progress.

        Select "4" to find a specific player and their progress.

        Select "5" to see how you rank compared to other players based on your survival days

        Select "7" to exit the game
 
    On the "OUTSIDE CABIN MENU":
        Select "1" to gather firewood. You have limited attempts per day.
        The number of logs you gather is random, so if you are unlucky you will get 0 logs...

        Select "2" to check the current temperature and resource inventory.
        Make sure to manage your resources and keep the fire burning to avoid hypothermia.

        Select "3" to enter the cabin.
        Staying in the cabin keeps you warm and safe, but you'll need logs to maintain the fire. 

    on the "INSIDE CABIN MENU":
        Select options "1" or "2" to burn logs to increase your character's temperature.
        You can enter the number of logs you want to burn or burn all of your collected logs at once.

        Select "3" to pass the day.
        Time passes, and the temperature drops. Your player stats are updated accordingly.

        Select "4" to check the current temperature and resource inventory.
        Your player's temperature is crucial. If it drops below a certain threshold, your character will die.

        Select "5" to enter the cabin or leave it.
        Leaving the cabin allows you to collect more resources to stay alive.
